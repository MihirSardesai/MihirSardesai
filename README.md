Hi, I’m Mihir Sardesai! I'm currently a senior at Dartmouth College double majoring in Government and Quantitative Social Science. I have an extensive background in R and experience in Python as well! Some of my past projects have examined misinformation tagging strategies on Twitter, news trust among partisans in India, and descriptive economic statistics in Europe. 

I plan on attending law school a couple years out of graduation, so I'm currently looking for research related roles in the social sciences!

You can reach me at mihir.sardesai.23@dartmouth.edu
